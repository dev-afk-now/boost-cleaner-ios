Questions, complaints or claims with respect to the Licensed Application should be directed to sharpforksltd@gmail.com

You acknowledge and accept that (i) the previsions of this EULA shall not be deemed to set an agreement between You and Apple (or its subsidiaries) in any manner whatsoever and (ii) Apple and its subsidiaries are third party beneficiaries of this EULA, therefore Apple and its subsidiaries shall have the right and are deemed to have accepted the right to enforce this EULA against You as a third party beneficiary thereof.
Please consider that the Licensed Application are licensed, not sold, to You for use only under the terms of this EULA, unless the same are accompanied by a different license agreement, in which case the terms of that different license agreement will govern the relationship between You and the Application Provider, subject to Your prior acceptance of that separate license agreement. The Application Provider reserves all rights not expressly granted to You hereinafter.
Application Provider may update the Licensed Application and/or the Services and/or this EULA from time to time in response to changing legal, technical or business developments. In such a case, Application Provider will take appropriate measures to inform You via the Licensed Application or the Services or otherwise, in accordance with the significance of the changes Application Provider makes. By continuing to access or use the Licensed Application and/or Services after updates become effective, You agree to be bound by the updated EULA.

a. Scope of License

According to this EULA, the Application Provider grants you with a non-transferable license to use for personal and non-commercial use the Licensed Application on any Apple iOS device that You own or control and in accordance with all applicable laws and Apple’s Usage Rules.

Any attempt to do so is a violation of the rights of the Application Provider and its licensors, if any. If You breach this restriction, You may be subject to prosecution and damages. The terms of the license will govern any upgrades provided by Application Provider that replace and/or supplement the Licensed Application, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a separate license, in which case the terms of that license shall prevail over this EULA.
